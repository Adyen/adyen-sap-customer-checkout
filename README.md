# Adyen SAP Customer Checkout

___

<!--
**<span style="color:red">IMPORTANT CHANGE</span>**

With Version 1.1.0 of the plugin the handling of the adyen certificates was changed. A java keystore is introduced. 
-->

## Prerequisites

___

* [Adyen Test Account](https://www.adyen.com/signup)
* Adyen Payment terminal
* SAP Customer Checkout
* [Adyen API Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/how-to-get-the-api-key) (if dynamic terminal choice is used)

## Installation and Configuration

___

### Plugin Installation

 **<span style="color:red">Prior to version 1.1.0</span>** 

Download the Adyen certificates from [here]((https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/choose-your-architecture/local/#install-root-cert)), rename them as shown and place them also in the AP folder.

![](resources/1000-AP_folder_with_certificates.png)

**<span style="color:red">With version 1.1.0 and later</span>**

Certificates are now automatically provided by the plugin with the certificates that were released by adyen at the day of the plugin release.   
The plugin will automatically create a java keystore file in CCOs AP folder. 

You can also define a different path to the java keystore containing the adyen certificates as well as a different password with the two new plugin properties:   
* ADYEN_KEY_STORE_FILE_PATH
* ADYEN_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD
   
![](resources/1200-new_certificate_properties.png)

Please restart CCO if you changed anything related to the key store.

#### Changing certificates in Java Keystore

Certificates usually have a valid to date. In case of the current adyen certificates it is 2048. In the unlikely event, that these certificates   
need to be updated in the keystore, please follow these instructions. You can also use tools like "[keystore explorer](https://keystore-explorer.org/)" if you are unfamiliar with cli commands.
   
##### Certificates to be imported
  - adyen-live.pem -> **Entry name:** adyen-terminalfleet-live
  - adyen-test.pem -> **Entry name:** adyen-terminalfleet-test

##### Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   1. The "keytool" command-line utility is included in the JDK.
   2. Ensure JDK is installed and added to your system path.
   3. If not installed, refer to official documentations on how to install JDK.
2. **Existing Java Keystore (adyen-cco-plugin.jks)**
   1. If the file does not exist, it will be created when the adyen plugin is loaded from CCO.
3. **Keystore Password**
   1. You must know or be in possession of the keystore password.

##### Steps to import or Update certificates

###### Windows & macOS

1. Open **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)** as Administrator in Windows or the terminal in macOS
2. Navigate to the directory containing the keystore and the certificates usually CCOs AP folder
   1. ```cd path\to\APfolder```
3. Import or update the adyen-live.pem certificate:
   1. ```keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -alias adyen-terminalfleet-live -file adyen-live.pem -keystore adyen-cco-plugin.jks -storepass YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD -noprompt```
4. Import or update the adyen.test.pem certificate:
   1. ```keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -alias adyen-terminalfleet-test -file adyen-test.pem -keystore adyen-cco-plugin.jks -storepass YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD -noprompt```
5. Verify that both certificates are correctly imported:
   1. ```keytool -list -keystore adyen-cco-plugin.jks -storepass YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD``` 

Restart CCO and look for any error messages from the plugin while CCO starts up. 


### Adding a store in Adyen backend

Please log into your adyen account and create a new store for your merchant account.

![](resources/2000-Store_Overview.png)

![](resources/3000-Store_Details.png)

**A:** Add Store reference for example e.g. A25

**B:** Add Store description

**C:** Add information which is shown on the shopper receipt

Add address and phone number and add the store. Afterwards assign your terminal to your newly created store. 
To achieve this, go to In-person payments -> Terminals. Click on the button "..." of the terminal and choose "Reassign".

### Terminal configuration

Connect your terminal to your local network. Either with LAN or via Wifi. Please consult the manuals for your specific terminal [here]([Get started manuals | Adyen Docs](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/user-manuals/)).

*Note: Usually the terminal has to be in the same network as the CCO instance. If this is not the case or not possible, please talk to your network administrators.*

### SAP Customer Checkout Configuration

Start your SAP CCO instance, login as User with administrative privileges and go to the configuration backend. In the tab *Accounting* open the subtab *Credit Card Type*.

![](resources/4000-Credit_Card_Type.png)

![](resources/4100-Credit_Cards.png)

Add a new credit card which will trigger the payment transaction on the adyen terminal. The card can be called *Adyen* but you can name the new card as you like. Set the visibility of all other cards (except the ones not handled by the payment terminal) to Visible = OFF but keep them active. The *Adyen* card should be visible.

| ADYEN_CARD_MAPPING<br/>![](resources/4200-Credit_Cards_small.png)   | *mc=3;amex=1;visa=2;visa_applepay=2;maestro=5*<br/>The adyen terminal will respond with an alphanumeric code as represenation for the card being used. The codes can be found [here](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/paymentmethodvariant/). This alphanumeric code has to be mapped to a specific credit card in CCO.Â <br/>The mapping works with an imaginary wildcard. This means, if you want to map all visa payment methods to CCO card 2 except visa_applepay and visabusiness, the mapping for visa could look like this:<br/><br/>visa=2;visa_applepay=3;visabusiness=5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Restart your CCO instance after the config. If any mandatory plugin property is missing, you will get a warning after the next login.

### Quickselection Buttons

This is only applicable, if you intend to use the ADYEN_DYNAMIC_TERMINAL_CHOICE feature. With these buttons the cashier can choose his "standard" terminal or delete his prior choice even without an open receipt or running payment transaction.

#### Standard Terminal Choice

Add a new quickselection button in CCO Manager and add the following string into the Extended JavaScript input field.
`"event" : { "eventName" : "ADY_ADD_STANDARD_TERMINAL_CHOICE" }`

<img src="resources/7000-QS_Std_Terminal.png" title="" alt="" width="651">

#### Remove Standard Terminal

Add a new quickselection button in CCO Manager and add the following string into the Extended Javascript input field.

`"event" : { "eventName" : "ADY_REMOVE_STANDARD_TERMINAL_CHOICE" }`

<img src="resources/7100-QS_Std_Terminal.png" title="" alt="" width="655">

### Translations

The Adyen plugin automatically deploys standard translations in the /cco/POSPlugins/translations folder. You can change the translations to your liking. 

*Note: Your translations files and changes will never be overwritten. So please check when using a newer version of the plugin, if new translation keys are present. E.g. rename the modified translation file, restart CCO so the plugin will deploy the new translation file with the original name.*

Â 

## Troubleshooting

The plugin writes messages into the SAP CCO log file. If any error occurs please consult the log file. This includes any error in the payment dialog in CCO.

provided adyenplugin-1.0.24-FP18 - suitable for CCO FP18 to FP20  
provided adyenplugin-1.0.24-FP16 - suitable for CCO FP16 & FP17

***2024-04-12***  

* Improvement: Actual values of card payments are now entered automatically. Thus, there should be no discrepancies in the daily closing.  
* Improvement: Chosen standard terminal will be saved even after cashier logged out once.
* Improvement: Return of a receipt with copied payment item which was originally paid with adyen will now open the terminal choice dialog if dynamic terminal choice is active.  
* Improvement: Card mapping works now like a regex. E.g. visadebit, visa, visacredit, visa_applepay... will now be mapped with a single visa=2  
  If visacredit should be mapped to another CCO card, this can be done with visa=2;visacredit=23
* Bugfix: Changing the CreditCardTypeCode could lead to an error in cashdesk closing when receipts were already posted with this card.
